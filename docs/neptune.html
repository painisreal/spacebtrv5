            <p>Neptune is the eighth and last planet from the sun in the solar system. It is a gas giant. It is the fourth largest and third heaviest planet. Neptune has four rings which are hard to see from the Earth. It is 17 times heavier than Earth and a little bit heavier than Uranus. It was named after the Roman God of the sea. Neptune’s atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. It also contains small amounts of methane which makes the planet appear blue.
                Neptune’s blue colour is much brighter compared to Uranus, so there might be another reason why Neptune is blue. Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system, measured as high as 2,100 km/h or 1,300 mph.
                Neptune was discovered by the astronomers, urbian Le Verrier and John Couch Adams. They were both honored for the discovery.</p>
