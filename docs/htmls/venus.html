            <p>Venus is the second planet from the sun. It is a terrestrial planet because it has a solid , rocky surface like other planets in the inner solar system. Astronomers have known Venus for the thousands of years. The ancient Romans named it after their goddness Venus . Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for the Moon. It is sometimes called the morning star or the evening star as it easily seen just before the sun comes up in the morning, and just after the sun goes down in the evening. Venus comes closer to the Earth than any other planet does. Venus is sometimes called the sister planet of Earth as they are quite similar in size and gravity. In other ways the planets are very different. Venus atmosphere(air) is mostly carbon dioxide with clouds of sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid isb a chemical that is very poisonus to humans. The thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface, and until the twenty-first century many people thought things might livethere.</p>
